The Drs. Donaldson developed and validated a nine dimensional measure of well-being called PERMA+4. Building on Seligman's PERMA model, PERMA+4 provides nine measurable building blocks of well-being that are shown to improve optimal functioning and performance.

This website provides definitions for each building block of PERMA+4, peer review publications, access to existing measures and scoring methods, and an outline of current and past projects that integrate PERMA+4.
