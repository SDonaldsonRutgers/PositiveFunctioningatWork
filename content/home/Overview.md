Dr. Stewart I. Donaldson and Dr. Scott I. Donaldson have developed measurement scales and practical tools to help researchers and practitioners assess, develop, and care for the PERMA+4 building blocks of well-being and positive functioning. Researchers and practitioners all across the globe are studying PERMA+4, and working with schools, universities, non-profit and for-profit organizations to develop and care for the building blocks of well-being, vitality, and positive functioning. The mission of the PERMA+4 collaborative is to develop a community that shares resources and scientific findings in an effort to promote more well-being and positive functioning worldwide.
